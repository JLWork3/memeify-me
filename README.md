# Lean Mean Meme Machine

##A super rad meme generator by LOLcat Labz
AKA Sarah Kim, Allison Bojarski, Dison Ruan, and Jaellys Bales

Access Code 2.1 @ [C4Q](http://www.c4q.nyc/)

###Features:
* Take a photo and...
* Create vanilla memes (your regular image with Impact typeface)!
* Create demotivational posters (for the cynic in us all)!
* Save your hilarious and surely original meme to camera roll!
* Share your meme via email, social media, etc.!
* For more, see project requirements: https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-2/blob/master/homework/week-0.md

###Breakdown:
* **Jae**: I took on an unofficial team lead role, coordinating with members, integrating their code within the project, managing our repo, etc. Lots of code surgery, testing, debugging. I coded the share functionality, general styling, and made layout edits. As far as time spent, I'd estimate 15 hours and counting (I did a lot of doc reading and debugging!). Will be adding other contributions for Sunday's demo.

* **Allison**: I created the camera.java and gallery.java files, working on them Sunday during class and also getting some assistance during office hours. I also was able to make myself available all day Thursday and most of Friday to help with debugging and adding on last-minute additions as we pulled the project together. I'd estimate I spent 30 hours on the project, between researching/learning, coding itself, getting better at git push/pull/merge, and testing/debugging.

###To-Dos:
* Fix auto-rotate of camera images captured in portrait.
* Finalize layouts.
* Add more options to meme editor.
* Add more templates!
* Super secret special bonus?! <3
